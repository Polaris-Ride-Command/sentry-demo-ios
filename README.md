Segue's
1. CMD+Click EmpowerPlantViewController icon (1st of 3) on Storyboard, drag to next ViewController
2. Click the new segueu line arrow -> Storyboard Segue options -> Identifier, set as goToCart


Storyboard > ViewController > Navigation Item > BackButton renaming does not work


Dragged 'Checkout' button to bottom but it displays in middle in the virtual device, maybe because added constraints for Horizontal/Vertical Orientation.
